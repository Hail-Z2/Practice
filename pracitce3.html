    Welcome to my travel blog, Love Travelling.  I’m Suhail, an award winning independent traveller writing about my visits to countries near and far.

I research destinations myself and that’s part of the fun – visiting the local library and selecting some travel guides, looking things up online and, of course, all the amazing tips I discover from fellow travel bloggers.

The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.

Augustine of Hippo
My passion is travel,  I just love visiting new places, immersing myself into local cultures of life around the world and discovering the unexpected!  Stepping off a plane, I’m always in a hurry to get my passport stamped, reclaim my luggage and walk out of the arrivals hall ready to begin a new adventure.
